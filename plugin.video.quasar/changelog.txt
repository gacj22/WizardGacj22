Quasar changelog
======

[B]v0.9.78[/B] - Apr 13 2017
- Hotfix for bad status error notification, #832
- Yet another fix for the regression of episodes not being
  marked as watched in library :fire: #821 #832

  since the introduction of the 'Resume playback from
  library integration' setting, #736

- Fixed season streaming (regression), #826
- Fixed episodes in library not being marked as
  watched (regression), #821
- Added support for automatic download and selection
  of subtitles within torrents

  watched state, scakemyer/quasar#31
- Better matching of active torrents with punctuation
  or mark characters

[B]v0.9.76[/B] - Apr 1 2017
- Fixed Titles / InfoLabels not being set when playing from
  home screen widgets, Torrents menu or WebUI, #739 #300 #256
- Added support for multi-part RAR archives, #613
    - Download will need to be completed before playback can
      start and will require around twice the amount of space
      to allow for extraction
    - Requires the `unrar` (or `unrar.exe` on Windows) utility
      to be installed globally on your system (in your $PATH)
- Added automatic selection of current episode in season packs
- Added `year` parameter to episode and season payloads
  to providers
- Torrents no longer get paused when starting to simply
  resume playback
- Fixed unicode path usage in overlay status
- Updated WebUI header image

[B]v0.9.75[/B] - Mar 2 2017
- Added feature to move finished downloads to separate folders,
  #440, #536, #97
  - Files will only be moved after seeding is finished (see
    BitTorrent settings), and will wait if currently playing
  - If the same item exists with library integration, the strm
    file will be removed to prevent duplicates, leaving you
    with a local file in your library instead :tada:
  - **Note**: Season packs still need work, since we move
    individual files and delete the folder afterwards, so
    you can easily lose a few episodes this way. This will
    be fixed in the next release, but I didn't want to delay
    this feature any longer. You've been warned until then.
- Properly check we have valid, writable, locally mounted paths
  and inform user otherwise, #768, #641, #440, #419...
- Fixed catch-all error notifications and regression from #740
- Possible fix for installation with Kodi from Windows Store,
  #547, #763
- Inform user which platform/architecture package was expected
  when getting the 'Unable to find Quasar binary' error, #772
- Total download/upload rates are now shown in the background
  progress dialog, along with per torrent rates, #754
- WebUI:
  - Fixed deleting multiple torrents (again) and added
    seeding progress bar
  - Added total download/upload rate stats
  - Improved responsive for tablet/mobile, #743


[B]v0.9.74[/B] - Feb 24 2017
- Clean up leftover .parts files when deleting torrents, and
  stale .parts files when starting up, #735
- Notify when getting custom Trakt lists and username isn't
  set, and log errors or bad status, #751
- Fixed missing fanart for Trakt items causing an Internal
  server error
- Fixed library strm files using /play and /links URIs after
  library refactor, preventing the 'Choose stream automatically'
  setting from being used, #745
- Fixed handling of unicode characters in Windows paths, #732
- Fixed handling of unicode characters in notifications, #740
- Fixed comparison of 'Next' labels with unicode characters
  for pagination handling, #752

- Fixed trackers that failed not updating progress indicator
- Removed skipping torrent resolver for public torrent files that have

- Using the 'Clear cache' option now only clears directory listing
  caches to reduce the load on TheMovieDB. If you absolutely need

  disables sound on all notifications, #695

[B]v0.9.63[/B] - Feb 1 2017
- Added all Trakt Calendars, #580
- Added Listen and Outgoing interfaces settings, #295
- Fixed regression in caching filestore, introduced in v0.9.61
  but manifesting itself mostly in v0.9.62, #684
- Fixed issue related to connections limit in libtorrent, and
  just use its default if no connections limit is set, fixes
  remaining 'stuck on Finding...' issues, #683
- Possible fix for crashes related to failing JSON-RPC calls
- Web UI optimizations, removed overly CPU-hungry progress
  bar animation, and show version numbers at the bottom


[B]v0.9.62[/B] - Jan 30 2017
- Fixed Trakt rate limiting to reduce errors with code 429
  - This will still need to be battle-tested, and other
    improvements are planned for this
- Fixed crashes when no JSON-RPC connection is available, #677
- Fixed crash when choosing Trakt as scraper for Kodi library
  content and content isn't actually scraped from Trakt, #673
- Fixed crashes in duplicate checking calls, #679
- Re-implemented proper automatic re-scan of Kodi library after
  updates and added setting in Advanced section (defaults to
  Enabled to match behavior prior to 0.9.61), #431
- Caching got seriously overhauled and improved.
  - Added cache warming on startup for near-instant
    loading of Trending / Most popular lists :fire:
  - Proper expiration times were finely tuned to make sure
    pages load as fast as possible, while always having
    fresh content and no more episodes not being updated
  - 5 pages of results are pre-fetched and cached to prevent
    results from shifting between pages. You **will**
    notice longer wait times every 5 page unless the shows
    and movies they contain have already been cached.
  - Please try not to use 'Clear cache' option, at all. And
    only if absolutely necessary otherwise. Clearing caches,
    contrary to popular belief, does not typically solve any
    issue in Quasar, on the contrary. It only causes added
    strain on everything by having to fetch the exact same
    information over and over again about movies and shows.
    - If you _do_ need to forcefully refresh something,
      head over to your userdata for Quasar and remove
      the specific file in question that starts with
      `page.`... Their names are now using easily
      recognizable patterns to allow selective clearing.
    - Improved, automated options will soon be added also.
  - Fixed TMDB lists not following the 'Results per page'
    setting, #468
- Cleanly notify when Quasar is still starting up
- Moved 'Torrents' above 'Add torrent', 'Trakt' above 'Search'
  in both Movies and TV Shows, and 'Genres' are now under their
  own directory in both sections
- Removing torrents from web UI no longer triggers
  'Ask to delete' in Kodi
- Label and alignment fixes in web UI, fixed header link
- Fixed 'Finished' torrents showing up as 'Paused'
- Renamed TV scraper setting to
  'TV show scraper used by Kodi library' for more clarity
- Golang was updated to 1.8rc3 and the stability and performance
  gains are significant. Of interest from their release notes:

> - The overhead of calls from Go into C has been reduced by
>   about half.
> - The new back end reduces the CPU time required by our
>   benchmark programs by 20-30% on 32-bit ARM systems. For
>   64-bit x86 systems, which already used the SSA back end
>   in Go 1.7, the gains are a more modest 0-10%. Other
>   architectures will likely see improvements closer to
>   the 32-bit ARM numbers. 


[B]v0.9.61[/B] - Jan 28 2017
- Complete overhaul of library integration
  - Duplicates are properly handled by default
    - Make sure you set the 'TV scraper used by library'
      according to your Kodi library content, defaults to
      TVDB like Kodi. This is needed to match the unique IDs
      of shows and episodes to properly detect duplicates,
      and the setting has been moved right under
      'Library path' to show its importance.
    - Removed confusing and now obsolete 'Ignore duplicates'
      setting, #632
  - Syncing lists with Trakt no longer re-adds manually removed
    movies and shows. If you add them back later on, they will
    start getting synced again, #632
  - Missing seasons and episodes can be added with the new
    'Merge to library' context menu on TV Shows, #632
    - Synced shows from Trakt automatically get merged
  - No more `QuasarDB.json`, it will automatically get imported
    into the brand new BoltDB library and removed if successful.
    The new library sits in your profile folder as `library.db`
  - Removing from library can now be done from Quasar
    like before, from the library directly, or by simply removing
    the .strm files and using Kodi's 'Clean library' feature
  - Quasar no longer triggers Kodi's library scan when it updates
    its internal library, ~~and never should have done so~~ this
    will be back as an option in the next release. It will
    instead ask you if you want to scan (or clean) your Kodi
    library when you add or remove an item managed by Quasar. For
    automatic re-scans and cleanups, use the fully-featured
    `XBMC Library Auto Update` add-on, or Kodi's own
    'Update library on startup' setting for one-time scans.
    - Pro-tip: Set Quasar's library update delay on startup
       1 minute lower than your automatic re-scan
- Added 'Show unaired seasons' and 'Show unaired episodes'
  settings, #633
- Copied the Trakt/Trending lists for movies and shows above
  'Most Popular' and 'Recent Episodes' respectively
- Only 'Choose stream...' or 'Choose stream automatically' show up
  in context menu depending on default preference
- Fixed various 'GetShow' and 'GetImages' errors
- Descriptive error handling, obscure "Navigation error" is
  gone for good :tada:
- Another attempt at better global and selective cache clearing
- Color-coded labels and statistics in web UI
- Translations now support placeholders

    'listen_port_min' and 'listen_port_max'
- Fixed crash when writing strm of a movie that can't be found, #625

  open more ports by default in case the user is running other torrent clients,
  but feel free to set both settings to 6881 if you only run Quasar)

- Upgraded to libtorrent 1.1.1
  - All your settings should work just as before
